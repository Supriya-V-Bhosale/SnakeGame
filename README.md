# SnakeGame

This is the classic  snake game created using HTML5, CSS and Javascript. The snake cannot stop moving, and dies whenever
it hits something. Because the snake is growing longer and longer as
the game progresses, it gets increasingly difficult to avoid collisions with the snake itself.
The player can change the direction of the head of the snake by using the arrow keys.

Here are some of the features of the game:-

1)Food is created at random position.

2)Snake is growing longer and longer as the snake eat food.

3)Head,food and body color are different.

4)Snake die whenever it hits on the wall or eat itself.

5)If snake die "Game over! Press any key to play again!" this messege pop on screen.
